Variable and datatypes:-

Variable:- Variable is the name given to the memory location.

Datatype:- Datatype is different type of container roles like integer ,float (decimal number) ,string. Basically there are five types of datatype are used on python and they are written below:-

1) string:It is the number of characters (a, b, c, d quoted inside the coma) string is written in double quoted coma like (”hello”).string should always be inside coma.
  There are three type of method for writting string. They are mentioned below:-
    1) single quoted coma (’a’):-This coma is normally used for indicate the code inside the container is string.
    2) Double quoted coma (”a”):-This coma is used if we want to use single cotted comma in the mid of the context as a shortcut key like ( I’m)  as part of the string.
    3) triple quoted coma (’’’a’’’):- Same as double cotted coma. also in this triple cotted coma we can write our code in multiple line where this isnot possible in single and double cotted coma.
       EG: a='''He said,"I like apple." to me'''

2) integer: An integer can be written without a comma, especially a number that can be known as an integer but if we write any word without indicating a comma (double code) it is also known as an integer (print(hello)). Integers either may be positive or negative (-1,+1).

3) float:

4) booleans

5) none
